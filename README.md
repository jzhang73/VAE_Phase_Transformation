# Generative model for 2H->1T phase transformation in MoWSe2 heterostructure

## Structural phase transitions in a MoWSe2 monolayer: Molecular dynamics simulations and variational autoencoder analysis

The training data set used to train the VAE model is generated from the MD simulation trajectory of MoWSe2 fracture. 

After training, the VAE model learnes the complex relaionship between different phases druing the strain induced 2H to 1T phase transformation in dynamic fracture of MoWSe2 heterostructure
